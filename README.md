demo e-commerce website created in 2016, styled with W3.CSS 1.9 by J.E.Refsnes and Extract from normalize.css by Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal git.io/normalize.

added some updates to this website design which i built in 2016 and uploaded it today to gitHub as part of my profile projects
it still needs some work as per links to item categories but i like the different look it has!
stay tuned..
